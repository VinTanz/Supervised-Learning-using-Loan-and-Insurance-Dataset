# Supervised Learning: Loan & Insurance Dataset
This repository contains implementations of various supervised learning algorithms applied to datasets related to loans and insurance. The algorithms included are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), several types of Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Decision Trees (DT), and Support Vector Classification (SVC).

Algorithms Included:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest (RF): An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Regression (various types): This includes Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Regression, among others. These models are used for predicting continuous outcomes.
Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT): An ensemble technique that builds a strong model by combining multiple weak models sequentially.
Decision Trees (DT): A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on the most significant attribute.
Support Vector Classification (SVC): A supervised learning algorithm that analyzes data and recognizes patterns, used for classification tasks.

How to Use:
Each algorithm has its own implementation within the repository. You can find the code along with documentation on how to use it effectively. Evaluation scripts are also provided to assess the performance of the models using accuracy metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
